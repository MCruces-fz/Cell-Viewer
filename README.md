# Cell Viewer
Graphical User Interface to view stats about the TRASGO detectors easily.

## How to use
You can check ascii files (`tryydoyhhmmss.hld_cell_entries.dat`) with `ascii_cell_viewer.py` or root files (`tryydoyhhmmss.hld.root.root`). First are faster to read and you can check the mean of hits in runs (around 25 minutes each run), with standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis; instead, reading root files you can measure a more accurate rate (in Hz).

First you need to log in FPTrucha by SSH with -XY flag:
```bash
ssh -XY user@fptrucha.usc.es
```
then, check if the files you want to read exist and if they're saved in 
```bash
utils/const.py
```
as UPPERCASE constants:
```python
ASCII_DATA_DIR="/path/to/png/"
# And / or:
ROOT_DATA_DIR="/path/to/rootfiles/"
```

Finally you need to execute
```bash
python3 ascii_cell_viewer.py
```
to read ascii files, or
```bash
python3 root_cell_viewer.py
```

I hope FPTrucha is not too busy, otherwise it will take him a bit to start the GUI...


## Motherboard disposition

### TRAGALDABAS
The motherboards are not in the same location as from the normal point 
of view, when you view TRAGALDABAS from the southwest (entering the door). 
Here are the cell layouts in both cases:

#### Motherboards on App:
They are in the same disposition that they are saved in ascii files.

| MB3 | MB2 |
|-----|-----|
| MB4 | MB1 |

#### Real disposition:
Below the table is the compass to locate you.

| MB2 | MB3 |
|-----|-----|
| MB2 | MB4 |
